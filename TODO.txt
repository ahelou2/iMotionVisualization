- SLERP: This is needed in order to make rotations smooth
=> https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Reference/Math/Quaternion
=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp

- I need to somehow align the phone's axis with the camera's axis. This will probably require
that I manipulate the quaternions after I understand it better.

- If it makes things easier and more correct, I should drop the motion simulation in favor of directly reading 
the rotation data off of the sensors. I can also directly read the quaternion.
